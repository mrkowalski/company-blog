The integration of generative AI into the corporate environment is frequently framed through the lens of efficiency. Organizations look at their existing workflows and ask how large language models might accelerate them. This perspective, while pragmatic, risks missing the transformative potential of the technology. It treats AI as a faster horse rather than a combustion engine. When we view AI solely as an automation tool for existing tasks, we fail to recognize that it fundamentally alters the nature of the "jobs to be done."

Clayton Christensen’s theory of Jobs to be Done argues that customers do not buy products or services; they hire them to make progress in their lives. In a corporate context, we hire processes, software, and employees to achieve specific strategic outcomes. The danger lies in confusing the means with the end. Much of our organizational machinery—the reports, the meetings, the documentation—are intermediate steps we have codified over decades to ensure quality or alignment. They are not the job itself.

Generative AI forces a re-evaluation of these intermediate steps. Consider the maintenance of a corporate knowledge base. For years, companies have invested heavily in wikis and repositories, hiring librarians and enforcing strict update cycles. The job to be done was never "maintain a wiki"; it was "ensure employees have access to accurate information." If an AI can synthesize answers from a raw document repository on demand, the intermediate step of curating a static knowledge base becomes obsolete. Automating the curation process would be a mistake; the goal is to eliminate the need for curation entirely.

We see a similar pattern in software engineering. We have long emphasized comprehensive code documentation. The job to be done is enabling a developer to understand and maintain a system. If an AI agent can explain a complex function or generate a readme on the fly, the necessity of writing and maintaining static comments diminishes. The value shifts from the artifact (the documentation) to the outcome (understanding).

This shift extends to human capital development. Corporate training often focuses on skill acquisition for tasks that may no longer require human intervention. If the job to be done is "analyze quarterly sales data," and an AI can perform this analysis autonomously, training a junior analyst to use spreadsheet macros is an inefficient allocation of resources. The training should instead focus on interpreting the AI's output and making strategic decisions based on it.

Furthermore, AI democratizes technical capability, allowing non-technical staff to perform jobs that previously required specialized skills. A marketing manager can now prototype an application or generate SQL queries without waiting for engineering resources. This flattens the execution curve and reduces the friction between having an idea and realizing it. It changes the job of the technical team from gatekeepers of execution to architects of reliability and scale.

For leaders responsible for strategy, the challenge is to look beyond the immediate gains of faster processing. The strategic imperative becomes identifying which corporate workflows are merely legacy scaffolding—structures built to support limitations that no longer exist. If a goal can be achieved directly through AI, automating the intermediate steps is a waste of effort.

The arrival of this technology requires a deliberate rethinking of our organizational habits. The task is to return to first principles and ask what progress we are trying to make. The answers will likely reveal that many of the jobs we have been so busy optimizing are no longer jobs that need to be done at all. The organizations that thrive will be those that use AI not just to do things better, but to do better things.
