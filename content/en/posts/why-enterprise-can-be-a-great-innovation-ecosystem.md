    key_theme: AI made _everyone_ think about innovation. Corporate environments are infamous for their challenges with rapid change and innovation, but in fact are structurally very well prepared to innovate. Small businesses are very often unable to match the pace and are not strategically positioned to do it. Startups are very risky and unreliable, attracting very different kinds of capital. Corporate innovation is very much a matter of proper strategy, management and positioning.
    key_insights:
    - Small businesses do not have ambitious growth targets. They work in a family-business mode with stable volume of clients.
    - Big companies have growth targets and access to means and tools and knowledge on how to manage innovation and growth.
    - Usually, managers are more capable and better trained in the corporate world.
    - Corporate world is known for its limited capacity for a change and innovation, but it usually applies mostly to a subset of core processes and businesses. With corporate resources, it is possible to structure innovative activities somehow separately to shake off big company red tape.
    - Key challenges to corporate innovation:
      - Corporate cultures happen to penalize mistakes. Innovation requires experimentation and a tolerance for failures, especially early.
      - Some corporate metrics are short-term focused. The pressure to meet quarterly earnings often overshadows the long-term investment and patience required to innovate.
      - Misinterpreting the JTBD framework: Teams frequently confuse a "job" with a product feature, an activity, or a customer demographic, entirely missing the underlying progress the customer is trying to achieve.
      - Siloed Organizational Structures: Executing a JTBD strategy requires cross-functional collaboration, but corporate silos often prevent departments from sharing customer insights.
      - Inflexible Legacy Processes: Traditional budgeting cycles and rigid product development timelines often strangle the agile, iterative processes needed to build JTBD-focused solutions. Taking risks and accepting failure does not fit traditional stability-focused processes.
      - Evaluating early-stage innovations using mature-market metrics (like strict ROI or market share) often demotes promising ideas before they have a chance to find their footing.
      - Innovation requires proper positioning and management support in order to avoid bad rap and influence of office politics on risky but potentially very promising initiatives. Some people may not want it to succeed.
