With over 20 years in the software industry — including nearly five years as a Chief Technology Officer - I have built systems that drive growth, and led engineering teams laser-focused on business value. I have learned firsthand that successful innovation is **engineered, not accidental**.

Today, I apply this experience to help clients capture the full power of Agentic and Voice AI. I bridge the gap between technical possibilities and business strategy, ensuring that innovation is balanced with compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR).

I am based in Poland, EU.
